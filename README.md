## Problem Domain

Create a app for tracking sewing patterns the user owns, would like to own or self drafted patterns.

Within the app the user should be able to track things like brand, pattern number, photo of pattern, categories, has it been made, user rating ease of use, actual notes on user experience with pattern, fabric used, measurements.

Within the wish list the user should be able to convert wishlist items to "owns" db list where it would be removed from wishlist and moved to db list.

The user should be able to filter any list by categories. The user should be able to search for any key words.
The user should be able to add additional categories, options to any pattern which will be recorded and implemented into the pre-used list.
